Welcome to the dev diary of Adventure Forge, my master's degree final project!

I'll try to keep track of my work on a daily/weekly basis. The purpose is also to record any work I can't commit, for instance when I work on a design or I follow a course to improve my skills.

The diary posts about non commitable works will be tagged as [**Mandatory Update**](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blogtags/mandatory-update).
