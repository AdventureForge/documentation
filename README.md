## Dev Diary

I am writing a dev diary about this project, it is updated at least once a week. You'll find it here : (https://adventureforge.github.io/documentation/blog)

If you are a College representative and you are only interested in the updates about the working days without commit, I post a new article at the end of each of those days. The article is commited to this repo and you will find all of them tagged as [**Mandatory Update**](https://adventureforge.github.io/documentation/blog/tags/mandatory-update) on the blog.
